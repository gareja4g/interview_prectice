## Core PHP Questions

### 1. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in PHP?

- `==` checks for **value equality**. It compares the values of two variables after type coercion (e.g., `0 == '0'` is true).
- `===` checks for **strict equality**. It compares both **value and type**, meaning the values must be of the same type and the same value (e.g., `0 === '0'` is false).

### 2. How does PHP handle sessions and cookies?

- **Sessions** store data on the server side. A unique session ID is sent to the user's browser as a cookie (`PHPSESSID` by default), and the server uses this ID to retrieve session data.
- **Cookies** store data on the client-side (browser). They are sent with every HTTP request to the server. Cookies have an expiration time, whereas sessions are destroyed after a specific time or when the user closes the browser.

### 3. Explain the difference between `include`, `require`, `include_once`, and `require_once`.

- **`include`**: Includes a file, but if it fails, it throws a warning and the script continues.
- **`require`**: Includes a file, and if it fails, it throws a fatal error and stops the script.
- **`include_once`**: Similar to `include`, but ensures the file is included only once.
- **`require_once`**: Similar to `require`, but ensures the file is included only once.

### 4. How can you prevent SQL injection in PHP?

- Use **prepared statements** with bound parameters (e.g., using PDO or MySQLi). This separates the SQL query from the data being passed, making it impossible for attackers to inject malicious SQL.
- Example using PDO:
  ```php
  $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email");
  $stmt->bindParam(':email', $email);
  $stmt->execute();
  ```

### 5. What is the difference between `explode()` and `implode()` functions?

- **`explode()`** splits a string into an array based on a delimiter.
  ```php
  $arr = explode(",", "apple,banana,orange");
  ```
- **`implode()`** (also known as `join()`) joins an array into a string with a specified delimiter.
  ```php
  $str = implode(",", $arr);
  ```

### 6. How does PHP handle error reporting? What are different error levels?

- PHP handles errors via **error reporting levels** set in the `php.ini` file or via the `error_reporting()` function.
- Common error levels:
  - `E_ERROR`: Fatal errors that stop the script.
  - `E_WARNING`: Non-fatal errors, the script continues.
  - `E_NOTICE`: Notices, usually for minor issues.
  - `E_ALL`: All errors, warnings, and notices.

### 7. What are traits in PHP? How do they differ from classes and interfaces?

- **Traits** allow code to be reused in multiple classes without using inheritance.
- They are not full classes and cannot be instantiated.
- Unlike interfaces, traits can have method implementations, while interfaces only define method signatures.

---

## OOP in PHP

### 8. What are the four pillars of OOP? Explain how PHP implements them.

- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal details and only exposing necessary parts (using private/protected/public access modifiers).
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation, using abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Inheritance**: One class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: One method can behave differently based on the object calling it (method overloading/overriding).

### 9. Explain the difference between `abstract class` and `interface` in PHP.

- An **abstract class** can have both abstract methods (no body) and concrete methods (with body). It allows partial implementation.
- An **interface** can only define method signatures (no method body), and a class implementing the interface must define all methods.

### 10. What is method overloading and overriding in PHP?

- **Overloading**: PHP does not support traditional method overloading (same method name with different parameters). However, magic methods like `__call()` can be used for dynamic method calls.
- **Overriding**: A subclass can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

### 11. What is the `static` keyword in PHP, and where can it be used?

- The `static` keyword is used to declare class properties or methods that are shared across all instances of a class.
- Static methods/properties are accessed using the class name, not through an object instance.
- Example:
  ```php
  class MyClass {
      public static $count = 0;
      public static function increment() {
          self::$count++;
      }
  }
  MyClass::increment();
  ```

### 12. What is dependency injection, and why is it useful in PHP?

- Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern where an object's dependencies (other objects it needs to function) are provided to it, rather than it creating them itself.
- This makes code more testable, decouples classes, and promotes reusability.

## PHP Frameworks (Laravel, CodeIgniter, Symfony, etc.)

### 13. What are the key features of Laravel?

- **Eloquent ORM**, **Blade templating engine**, **Artisan CLI**, **Routing**, **Middleware**, **Authentication**, **Database Migrations**, **Queues**, **Task Scheduling**.

### 14. What is the difference between Eloquent ORM and Query Builder in Laravel?

- **Eloquent ORM**: Active Record implementation that provides an object-oriented approach to interact with the database.
- **Query Builder**: A more raw, flexible way to interact with the database, using SQL queries in a fluent interface.

### 15. How does Laravel handle middleware?

- Middleware in Laravel filters HTTP requests entering the application. It can perform actions like authentication, logging, or modifying request/response objects.
- Middleware is registered in the `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

### 16. Explain Service Providers in Laravel.

- Service providers are the central place to bind classes into the service container in Laravel. They are responsible for bootstrapping components and services.

### 17. How does CodeIgniter handle MVC architecture?

- CodeIgniter follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern, where:
  - **Model** interacts with the database.
  - **View** handles the display (user interface).
  - **Controller** handles user input and updates the model and view.

## Database and Optimization

### 18. What is the difference between MyISAM and InnoDB storage engines?

- **MyISAM**: Faster read operations but doesn't support foreign keys and transactions.
- **InnoDB**: Supports transactions, foreign key constraints, and better crash recovery.

### 19. What are indexes in MySQL? How do they help performance?

- Indexes speed up retrieval of rows based on columns. They create a data structure (like a B-tree) that makes searching much faster.
- However, they slow down write operations (insert, update, delete) due to the need to update the index.

### 20. What is database normalization? Explain different normal forms.

- Database normalization is the process of structuring data to avoid redundancy and dependency.
- **1st Normal Form (1NF)**: Eliminate repeating groups (atomic values).
- **2nd Normal Form (2NF)**: Remove partial dependencies (non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key).
- **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**: Eliminate transitive dependencies (non-key attributes must depend only on primary key).

### 21. How can you optimize a slow-performing MySQL query?

- Use **indexes** on frequently searched columns.
- Optimize joins (ensure proper indexes are used).
- Use **EXPLAIN** to analyze the query execution plan.
- Avoid **SELECT \*;** only retrieve necessary columns.
- Minimize subqueries and optimize WHERE clauses.

### 22. How can you handle database transactions in PHP?

- Use the `beginTransaction()`, `commit()`, and `rollBack()` methods in PDO to handle transactions. This ensures that multiple queries either complete successfully or roll back if there is an error.
- Example:
  ```php
  $pdo->beginTransaction();
  try {
      // Query 1
      // Query 2
      $pdo->commit();
  } catch (Exception $e) {
      $pdo->rollBack();
  }
  ```

## Security in PHP

### 23. What are the common security vulnerabilities in PHP applications?

- **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, **Insecure file uploads**, **Session Hijacking**.

### 24. How can you prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) in PHP?

- **Sanitize** user inputs using `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent execution of malicious scripts.
- Use **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers to restrict resources.

### 25. How can you prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks?

- Use **CSRF tokens** in forms, which are checked for validity on form submission.
- Laravel, for example, automatically includes a CSRF token in forms.

### 26. How does password hashing work in PHP?

- Use `password_hash()` to hash passwords and `password_verify()` to verify them. The `password_hash()` function uses a strong one-way hashing algorithm like bcrypt.
- Example:
  ```php
  $hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
  ```

## Design Patterns in PHP

### 27. What are design patterns? Name some commonly used patterns in PHP.

- Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. Common patterns in PHP:
  - **Singleton**, **Factory**, **Observer**, **Decorator**, **Strategy**, **MVC**.

### 28. Explain the Singleton pattern with an example.

- The **Singleton pattern** ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- Example:
  ```php
  class Singleton {
      private static $instance;
      private function __construct() {}
      public static function getInstance() {
          if (!self::$instance) {
              self::$instance = new Singleton();
          }
          return self::$instance;
      }
  }
  ```

### 29. What is the Factory design pattern?

- The **Factory pattern** provides an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. It separates object creation logic from the client.

### 30. How does the MVC pattern work in PHP frameworks?

- In the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, the:
  - **Model** manages data and business logic.
  - **View** is responsible for presenting the user interface.
  - **Controller** handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

# PHP Optimization Functions for Arrays and Strings

## Array Optimization Functions

### 1. `array_map()`

  ```php
  $result = array_filter($array, 'is_numeric');
  ```

### 3. `array_reduce()`

- Iteratively reduces an array to a single value using a callback function.
  ```php
  $result = array_reduce($array, function($carry, $item) {
      return $carry + $item;
  });
  ```

### 4. `array_walk()`

- Applies a user-defined function to every element in an array.
  ```php
  array_walk($array, function(&$item, $key) {
      $item = strtoupper($item);
  });
  ```

### 5. `array_chunk()`

- Splits an array into chunks of a specified size.

  ```php
  $result = array_unique($array);
  ```

### 8. `array_column()`

- Returns the values from a single column in the input array.
  ```php
  $names = array_column($array, 'name');
  ```

### 9. `array_intersect()`

- Computes the intersection of arrays (elements common to all arrays).
  ```php
  $result = array_intersect($array1, $array2);
  ```

### 10. `array_diff()`

- Computes the difference between arrays (elements in the first array but not in the others).
  ```php
  $result = array_diff($array1, $array2);
  ```

## String Optimization Functions

### 1. `str_replace()`

- Replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring.
  ```php
  $result = str_replace('foo', 'bar', $string);
  ```

### 2. `substr()`

- Returns a portion of a string specified by the start and length parameters.
  ```php
  $result = substr($string, 0, 5);
  ```

### 3. `strpos()`

- Finds the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string.
  ```php
  $position = strpos($string, 'needle');
  ```

### 4. `str_split()`

- Splits a string into an array of characters or specified length.
  ```php
  $result = str_split($string, 2);
  ```

### 5. `trim()`

- Removes whitespace (or other characters) from the beginning and end of a string.
  ```php
  $result = trim($string);
  ```

### 6. `strtolower()` and `strtoupper()`

- Converts a string to lowercase or uppercase.
  ```php
  $lowercase = strtolower($string);
  $uppercase = strtoupper($string);
  ```

### 7. `explode()`

- Splits a string into an array based on a delimiter.
  ```php
  $result = explode(',', $string);
  ```

### 8. `implode()`

- Joins array elements into a string with a specified delimiter.
  ```php
  $result = implode('-', $array);
  ```

### 9. `substr_count()`

- Counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.
  ```php
  $count = substr_count($string, 'needle');
  ```

### 10. `sprintf()`

- Returns a formatted string, similar to `printf()` but without printing it.
  ```php
  $formatted = sprintf('Hello, %s!', $name);
  ```

## General PHP Optimization Techniques for Arrays and Strings

- **Use references** (`&`) when manipulating large arrays or strings to avoid unnecessary copying.
- **Avoid `array_merge()`** in loops for large datasets as it can lead to performance issues. Use direct array merging via the `+` operator instead.
- **Avoid using `implode()` repeatedly** for large arrays inside loops, as it can be costly.
- **Use `array_map()` or `array_walk()`** instead of traditional `foreach` loops for better performance in some scenarios.
