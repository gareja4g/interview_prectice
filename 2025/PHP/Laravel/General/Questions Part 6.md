## 🛠 Example: Creating and Using Laravel Resources

### ✅ Step 1: Generate a Resource Class

```sh
php artisan make:resource UserResource
```

This creates `app/Http/Resources/UserResource.php`.

### ✅ Step 2: Define the Resource Structure

Modify `UserResource.php`:

```php
namespace App\Http\Resources;

use Illuminate\Http\Resources\Json\JsonResource;

class UserResource extends JsonResource {
    public function toArray($request) {
        return [
            'id' => $this->id,
            'name' => $this->name,
            'email' => $this->email,
            'created_at' => $this->created_at->toDateString(),
        ];
    }
}
```

### ✅ Step 3: Use the Resource in a Controller

```php
use App\Http\Resources\UserResource;
use App\Models\User;

class UserController extends Controller {
    public function show($id) {
        $user = User::findOrFail($id);
        return new UserResource($user);
    }
}
```

### ✅ Step 4: Returning a Collection of Resources

```php
use App\Http\Resources\UserResource;

public function index() {
    return UserResource::collection(User::all());
}
```

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

class UserSeeder extends Seeder {
    public function run() {
        User::create([
            'name' => 'John Doe',
            'email' => 'john@example.com',
            'password' => Hash::make('password123'),
        ]);
    }
}
```

### ✅ Step 3: Run the Seeder

Execute the seeder with:

```sh
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
```

Or run all seeders:

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```

### ✅ Step 4: Use Seeders in `DatabaseSeeder.php`

Modify `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`:

```php
public function run() {
    $this->call([
        UserSeeder::class,
    ]);
}
```

Now, running `php artisan db:seed` will execute all defined seeders.

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "error": "User not found"
}
```

---

## 🛠 When to Use HTTP Status Codes?

- **Use `2xx` for success** (e.g., `200 OK`, `201 Created`).
- **Use `4xx` for client errors** (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`).
- **Use `5xx` for server errors** (e.g., `500 Internal Server Error`, `503 Service Unavailable`).

# 59) 🚀 What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a compact, URL-safe token format used for **secure authentication** and data exchange between parties.

---

## 🔍 Definition

JWT is a **self-contained, digitally signed token** that encodes user information in a JSON format. It is widely used in **stateless authentication systems**.

---

## 🛠 Role of JWT in Authentication

### ✅ 1. **Token-Based Authentication**

JWT allows users to authenticate once and use the token for multiple requests without re-authentication.

### ✅ 2. **Stateless API Communication**

Unlike session-based authentication, JWT eliminates the need for server-side session storage.

### ✅ 3. **Secure Data Transmission**

JWT tokens are digitally signed, ensuring **data integrity and security**.

---

## 🛠 JWT vs. Session-Based Authentication

| Feature          | JWT Authentication                            | Session-Based Authentication          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Storage**      | Client-side (local storage/cookies)           | Server-side (session storage)         |
| **Statefulness** | Stateless                                     | Stateful                              |
| **Scalability**  | Highly scalable (no session storage required) | Requires server-side session tracking |
| **Security**     | Secure if signed properly                     | Vulnerable to session hijacking       |

---

## 🛠 Example: Implementing JWT in Authentication

### ✅ Step 1: Install JWT Package (Laravel Example)

```sh
composer require tymon/jwt-auth
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
```

### ✅ Step 2: Configure Authentication Driver in `config/auth.php`

```php
'guards' => [
    'api' => [
        'driver' => 'jwt',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
],
```

### ✅ Step 3: Generating a JWT Token

```php
use Tymon\JWTAuth\Facades\JWTAuth;

public function login(Request $request) {
    $credentials = $request->only('email', 'password');
    if (!$token = JWTAuth::attempt($credentials)) {
        return response()->json(['error' => 'Unauthorized'], 401);
    }
    return response()->json(['token' => $token]);
}
```

### ✅ Step 4: Protecting Routes with JWT Middleware

```php
Route::middleware(['auth:api'])->get('/user', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user();
});
```

---

## 🛠 When to Use JWT?

- **When building scalable, stateless APIs**.
- **When requiring authentication across multiple domains (Single Sign-On - SSO).**
- **When handling mobile or SPA authentication where cookies are not ideal.**

# 60) 🚀 What is the difference between Passport, Sanctum, and JWT?

**Laravel Passport, Sanctum, and JWT** are authentication solutions in Laravel, each designed for different use cases.

---

## 🔍 Comparison of Laravel Passport, Sanctum, and JWT

| Feature                 | Laravel Passport               | Laravel Sanctum              | JWT (JSON Web Token)      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Authentication Type** | OAuth2                         | Token-based                  | Token-based               |
| **Use Case**            | Full OAuth2 authentication     | Simple API authentication    | Stateless authentication  |
| **Best For**            | Third-party API authentication | SPAs & mobile apps           | Scalable APIs             |
| **Security**            | Secure with OAuth scopes       | CSRF protection for web apps | Secure if signed properly |
| **Requires Laravel?**   | ✅ Yes                         | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No                     |

## 🛠 Use Cases for Each Authentication Method

### ✅ Laravel Passport (OAuth2 Authentication)

- Best for **third-party API authentication**.
- Provides **OAuth2 flows** (Password Grant, Client Credentials, etc.).
- Uses **personal access tokens**.

### ✅ Laravel Sanctum (Lightweight API Authentication)

- Best for **single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile apps**.
- Uses **simple token authentication**.
- Supports **session-based authentication** for web apps.

### ✅ JWT (Stateless API Authentication)

- Best for **scalable, stateless APIs**.
- Works **independently of Laravel**.
- Tokens **contain user data**, reducing DB queries.

---

## 🛠 Example Implementations

### ✅ Laravel Passport Token Generation

```php
$token = auth()->user()->createToken('MyAppToken')->accessToken;
return response()->json(['token' => $token]);
```

### ✅ Laravel Sanctum Authentication

```php
use Laravel\Sanctum\Sanctum;

$user = User::find(1);
$token = $user->createToken('token-name')->plainTextToken;
```

### ✅ JWT Authentication Example

```php
use Tymon\JWTAuth\Facades\JWTAuth;

$token = JWTAuth::attempt(['email' => 'test@example.com', 'password' => 'password']);
return response()->json(['token' => $token]);
```

---

## 🛠 When to Use Passport, Sanctum, or JWT?

- **Use Passport** when working with **OAuth2 authentication**.
- **Use Sanctum** for **SPAs, mobile apps, and simple API authentication**.
- **Use JWT** for **stateless APIs with scalable authentication**.
