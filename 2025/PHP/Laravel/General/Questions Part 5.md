# 41) 🚀 What is a Request Class in Laravel?

A **Request Class** in Laravel is a dedicated class that handles HTTP request validation and authorization, making controllers cleaner and more maintainable.

---

## 🔍 Definition

A **Request Class** in Laravel is an extension of `Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest`, used to encapsulate validation and authorization logic separately from controllers.

---

## 🛠 Why Use a Request Class?

### ✅ 1. **Cleaner Controllers**

Moving validation logic to request classes keeps controllers focused on business logic.

### ✅ 2. **Reusable Validation Rules**

A single request class can be reused across multiple controllers, reducing duplication.

### ✅ 3. **Built-in Authorization Handling**

Request classes allow defining authorization rules within the class itself.

---

## 🛠 Comparing Traditional Request Handling vs. Request Classes

### ❌ Traditional Request Handling (Controller-Based Validation)

```php
public function store(Request $request) {
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'name' => 'required|string',
        'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email',
    ]);

    User::create($validated);
    return response()->json(['message' => 'User created!']);
}
```

### ✅ Using a Request Class for Validation

```sh
php artisan make:request StoreUserRequest
```

Modify the generated `StoreUserRequest.php`:

```php
namespace App\Http\Requests;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;

class StoreUserRequest extends FormRequest {
    public function authorize() {
        return true; // Modify if role-based authorization is needed
    }

    public function rules() {
        return [
            'name' => 'required|string',
            'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email',
        ];
    }
}
```

### ✅ Using the Request Class in a Controller

```php
public function store(StoreUserRequest $request) {
    User::create($request->validated());
    return response()->json(['message' => 'User created!']);
}
```

---

## 🛠 When to Use a Request Class?

- **When handling complex validation logic** that needs to be reusable.
- **When keeping controllers clean** and focused on core logic.
- **When requiring built-in authorization checks** at the request level.

A **Policy** is a dedicated class in Laravel that encapsulates **authorization logic** for a specific model, allowing developers to manage permissions cleanly and efficiently.

---

## 🛠 Role of Policies in Authorization

### ✅ 1. **Encapsulating Authorization Logic**

Policies centralize authorization logic within a single class instead of spreading it across controllers.

### ✅ 2. **Model-Specific Authorization**

Each policy is tied to a model, ensuring precise access control.

### ✅ 3. **Integration with Gates and Middleware**

Policies work seamlessly with **Gates**, `can()` methods, and middleware for authorization checks.

---

## 🛠 Policies vs. Gates

| Feature           | Policies                       | Gates                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Scope**         | Tied to models                 | General-purpose checks               |
| **Structure**     | Class-based                    | Closure-based                        |
| **Usage**         | Best for model-related actions | Best for broader application logic   |
| **Example Usage** | `PostPolicy@update`            | `Gate::allows('update-post', $post)` |

---

## 🛠 Example: Creating and Using a Policy

### ✅ Step 1: Generate a Policy Class

```sh
php artisan make:policy PostPolicy --model=Post
```

This creates `app/Policies/PostPolicy.php`.

### ✅ Step 2: Define Authorization Logic

Modify `PostPolicy.php`:

```php
namespace App\Policies;

use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;

class PostPolicy {
    public function update(User $user, Post $post) {
        return $user->id === $post->user_id;
    }
}
```

### ✅ Step 3: Register the Policy in `AuthServiceProvider.php`

```php
protected $policies = [
    Post::class => PostPolicy::class,
];
```

### ✅ Step 4: Using the Policy in a Controller

```php
public function update(Request $request, Post $post) {
    $this->authorize('update', $post);

    // Update logic here
}
```

---

## 🛠 When to Use Policies?

- **When managing model-specific authorization rules.**
- **When centralizing access control logic** instead of defining it in controllers.
- **When using Laravel’s built-in `authorize()` and `can()` methods.**

# 45) 🚀 What are Laravel Events and Listeners?

**Laravel Events and Listeners** provide a way to implement the observer pattern, allowing different parts of the application to communicate asynchronously.

---

## 🔍 Definition

### ✅ Events

An **event** in Laravel represents an action that has occurred in the application, such as a user registration or an order completion.

### ✅ Listeners

A **listener** is a class that responds to a specific event and executes logic, such as sending an email or logging activity.

---

## 🛠 When to Use Events and Listeners?

- **Decoupling business logic** to make the application more maintainable.
- **Handling background tasks** asynchronously via listeners.
- **Broadcasting real-time events** to WebSockets.

---

## 🛠 Example: Implementing Events and Listeners

### ✅ Step 1: Creating an Event

Generate an event class using Artisan:

```sh
php artisan make:event UserRegistered
```

This creates `app/Events/UserRegistered.php`.

Modify `UserRegistered.php`:

```php
namespace App\Events;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class UserRegistered {
    use Dispatchable, SerializesModels;

    public $user;

    public function __construct(User $user) {
        $this->user = $user;
    }
}
```

### ✅ Step 2: Creating a Listener

Generate a listener class:

```sh
php artisan make:listener SendWelcomeEmail --event=UserRegistered
```

This creates `app/Listeners/SendWelcomeEmail.php`.

Modify `SendWelcomeEmail.php`:

```php
namespace App\Listeners;

use App\Events\UserRegistered;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
use App\Mail\WelcomeEmail;

class SendWelcomeEmail implements ShouldQueue {
    public function handle(UserRegistered $event) {
        Mail::to($event->user->email)->send(new WelcomeEmail($event->user));
    }
}
```

### ✅ Step 3: Registering Events and Listeners

Add event-listener mapping in `EventServiceProvider.php`:

```php
protected $listen = [
    UserRegistered::class => [
        SendWelcomeEmail::class,
    ],
];
```

### ✅ Step 4: Dispatching an Event

Trigger the event when a user registers:

```php
use App\Events\UserRegistered;

public function register(Request $request) {
    $user = User::create($request->all());
    event(new UserRegistered($user));
}
```

---

## 🛠 When to Use Events and Listeners?

# 46) 🚀 How do you schedule tasks using Laravel Cron?

**Task scheduling** in Laravel allows you to automate repetitive tasks using Laravel’s built-in scheduler, which leverages Cron jobs.

---

## 🔍 Definition

**Task scheduling** in Laravel is managed via the `schedule` method inside the `app/Console/Kernel.php` file, allowing commands and closures to be executed at predefined intervals.

---

## 🛠 How Laravel’s Scheduler Works

### ✅ 1. **Single Cron Job Setup**

Instead of defining multiple Cron jobs, Laravel uses a **single Cron entry** that runs every minute:

```sh
* * * * * php /path-to-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### ✅ 2. **Defining Scheduled Tasks**

Tasks are scheduled in `app/Console/Kernel.php` inside the `schedule` method:

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule) {
    $schedule->command('daily:report')->dailyAt('23:00');
}
```

### ✅ 3. **Running Console Commands on Schedule**

Create a new custom Artisan command:

```sh
php artisan make:command DailyReport
```

Modify `app/Console/Commands/DailyReport.php`:

```php
namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use App\Models\Report;

class DailyReport extends Command {
    protected $signature = 'daily:report';
    protected $description = 'Generate and email daily report';

    public function handle() {
        Report::generateDaily();
        $this->info('Daily report generated successfully!');
    }
}
```

### ✅ 4. **Scheduling Closures Instead of Commands**

Alternatively, you can schedule direct actions using closures:

```php
$schedule->call(function () {
    \Log::info('Scheduled task executed.');
})->hourly();
```

---

## 🛠 When to Use Laravel Task Scheduling?

- **When automating repetitive tasks** like report generation and backups.
- **When avoiding multiple system Cron jobs** by using Laravel’s scheduler.
- **When sending periodic notifications or emails.**

    use InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;
    public $message;

    public function __construct($message) {
        $this->message = $message;
    }

    public function broadcastOn() {
        return ['chat-channel'];
    }
}
```

### ✅ Step 5: Listen for Events in JavaScript

Modify `resources/js/app.js`:

```js
import Echo from "laravel-echo";
import Pusher from "pusher-js";

window.Pusher = Pusher;
window.Echo = new Echo({
  broadcaster: "pusher",
  key: process.env.MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
  cluster: process.env.MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
  forceTLS: true,

| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Accessibility**     | Private                        | Public                          |
| **Usage**             | User uploads, backups, logs    | Static assets (CSS, JS, images) |
| **Direct URL Access** | ❌ No (Requires symbolic link) | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Helper Function**   | `storage_path()`               | `public_path()`                 |

## 🛠 Example: When to Use Each

### ✅ Storing Files in Storage (Private)

Save a file in the `storage/app` directory:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

Storage::put('private/user-data.txt', 'Sensitive data');
```

Retrieve the file:

```php
$contents = Storage::get('private/user-data.txt');
```

### ✅ Storing Files in Public Directory (Public)

Save a file directly accessible by users:

```php
$file->move(public_path('uploads'), $fileName);
```

Access via URL:

```html
<img src="/uploads/image.jpg" alt="Image" />
```

### ✅ Creating a Symlink to Storage for Public Access

If user uploads need public access, create a symbolic link:

```sh
php artisan storage:link
```

Now files stored in `storage/app/public` can be accessed via `/storage/file.jpg`.

## 🛠 When to Use Storage vs. Public?

- **Use Storage** for private user uploads, logs, and sensitive data.
- **Use Public** for assets like CSS, JS, and publicly accessible images.
- **Use Storage with Symlink** for user uploads that need web access.
